# Quick Guide for Running the FastAPI Application

## Introduction

This FastAPI application provides two key endpoints:

- `/chat/`: A chatbot endpoint to interact with a medical AI assistant.
- `/create_summary/`: Generates a concise medical history summary for a patient based on structured input.

## How It Works

### Environment Setup

- The app uses OpenAI for AI-based summarization, and API keys are managed via environment variables.
- Models and schemas validate patient data to ensure structured, readable summaries are created.

### Endpoints

- `/chat/`: Accepts a conversation history and user input to return a chatbot response.
- `/create_summary/`: Processes structured patient data and returns a summarized version of the medical history.

### Key Functionalities

- `process_patient_data`: Converts patient data into a readable string.
- `create_medical_summary`: Calls the AI model to summarize medical history.

## Steps to Run


### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```plaintext
NEBIUS_API_KEY=<your-nebius-api-key>
```

### Run the Server

Start the FastAPI application using uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Test the Endpoints

Open your browser or Postman and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation.

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Chat Endpoint

**POST `/chat/`**

**Request Body:**

```json
{
    "conversation_history": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful medical assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination, increased thirst, and fatigue."}
    ],
    "user_input": "How is diabetes treated?"
}
```

**Response:**

        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Diabetes is treated with medication, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring."}
    ]
}
```

### 2. Create Summary Endpoint

**POST `/create_summary/`**

**Request Body:**

## How the Code Works

### `process_patient_data(data)`

Transforms structured patient data into a human-readable string.

### `create_medical_summary(medical_history)`

Uses the AI model to generate a concise summary of the patient's medical history.

### Endpoints

- `/chat/`: Provides a chatbot-like interface.
- `/create_summary/`: Creates a medical summary for healthcare providers.

### Error Handling

Handles API errors with HTTP exceptions to ensure clear debugging.
